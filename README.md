# COVID-XAI

This project provides an Explainable AI (XAI) model for detecting COVID-19 from medical data. It focuses on interpreting machine learning models' decisions to ensure transparency and trust.

## Features
- Uses machine learning algorithms to detect COVID-19.
- Implements explainability techniques like SHAP and LIME.
- Visualizes key features contributing to model predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `shap`, `lime`, etc.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook.
